This aims to standardize the structure of errors when they need to be transmitted (e.g., over RPC).\n3.  **Application-Level Error Reporting:** The test file (`errors.test.ts`) demonstrates an application-level pattern where errors occurring during a job's execution are reported within the *body* of a successful HTTP response (HTTP 200).

            "**Potential Information Disclosure:** The error message for non-201 responses includes `response.statusText` directly: `Failed to provision Neon Auth. Error: ${response.statusText}`. While `statusText` is often generic (e.g., 'Not Found', 'Internal Server Error'), it originates from the external API client and could potentially contain more specific internal details than desired, especially if the Neon API client populates it with detailed error strings.",

            "**Potential for Inconsistent Error Formats:** While the explicitly handled errors return a consistent structure (`{ isError: true, content: [...] }`), unhandled exceptions (due to the lack of `try...catch`) will likely result in a different error format, depending on how the calling code or framework handles them.",
            "**Lack of Graceful Degradation for Unexpected Errors:** The function handles specific known 'error' states (missing resources, non-201 status) but will likely fail abruptly (unhandled rejection) on unexpected issues like network errors or Neon API server errors (5xx), rather than returning a controlled error message.",
            "**Stack Traces Potentially Exposed (Indirectly):** Although the explicitly handled errors don't expose stack traces, the unhandled exceptions could lead to stack traces being logged or even sent back to the client if higher-level error handling is not configured securely.",

            "**Implement Server-Side Logging:** Add logging within the function.

            "**Incomplete Validation (String Lengths):** Some free-form string fields (e.g., `comment` in `UpdateDeploymentSchema`, `filter` in various schemas) lack maximum length validation (`.max()`), which could potentially lead to resource exhaustion or database issues if excessively long inputs are provided.",

The descriptions hint at a specific query-like syntax. If these strings are directly used or concatenated into database queries (SQL or NoSQL) or other interpreted contexts *without* proper parameterization or escaping in the backend logic, this creates a significant **SQL/Query Injection** vulnerability.

Use parameterized queries or dedicated, safe query-building libraries that parse the filter structure securely. Consider adding a `.regex()` in the schema to enforce the *expected simple syntax* of the filter string as a first line of defense, rejecting overly complex or malformed inputs early.",
            "**Secure File Path Handling:** **Critically**, sanitize and validate the `filePath` input string before using it in any file system operations. Normalize the path, ensure it resolves to an expected base directory, and explicitly disallow directory traversal sequences (`../`).",

It relies on exceptions raised by the underlying `airflow_client` library (`import_error_api` calls) to propagate up the call stack. Any handling would need to occur in the calling code or potentially via a framework's global error handler or middleware (though none are defined or used within this specific file).",
          "findings": [
            "**Information Disclosure Risk:** If an exception occurs during the `import_error_api` calls (e.g., network error, Airflow API error, unexpected response format), and it's not caught by an upstream handler, the raw exception and stack trace could be exposed. This often reveals internal paths, library versions, and potentially sensitive configuration details.",
            "**Stack Traces Exposed:** Directly related to the above, the lack of local `try-except` blocks means stack traces will propagate upwards, increasing the risk of exposure if not handled carefully by the calling framework.",
            "**Inconsistent Error Formats:** Successful requests return data formatted as `List[types.TextContent(...)]`. Errors, however, will manifest as unhandled exceptions. If a framework catches this and returns a generic error page/response, it will be in a completely different format than the expected success response, making client-side handling difficult.",
            "**Missing Error Logging:** There is no logging within these functions. If an API call fails, the error isn't logged at this level, making debugging difficult. Relying solely on upstream logging might miss context specific to these functions (like the parameters used: `limit`, `offset`, `import_error_id`).",
            "**Improper HTTP Status Codes:** This code itself doesn't handle HTTP responses, but if it's part of a web service (likely, given the async nature), an unhandled exception will probably result in a generic 500 Internal Server Error. This hides the actual cause. For instance, if `get_import_error` is called with an ID that doesn't exist, the Airflow API might return a 404. This should ideally be translated to a 404 response by the service using this code, not a 500.",
            "**Lack of Graceful Degradation:** The functions will completely fail if the underlying API call fails. There's no attempt to return a partial response, cached data (if applicable), or even a structured error message within the expected `List[types.TextContent]` format (e.g., `[types.TextContent(type='error', text='Failed to retrieve import errors')]`). The only outcomes are success or a potentially crashing exception."
          ],
          "recommendations": [
            "**Implement Explicit Error Handling:** Wrap the `import_error_api` calls within `try...except` blocks.",
            "**Catch Specific Exceptions:** Catch exceptions known to be raised by `airflow_client` (e.g., `ApiException`, network errors like `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` if it uses requests, or equivalent asyncio network errors). Avoid catching generic `Exception` unless re-raising or handling very carefully.",
            "**Log Errors:** Log exceptions with relevant context (function name, parameters, timestamp) before handling or re-raising them. Use a standard logging library.",
            "**Return Structured Error Responses:** Instead of letting exceptions propagate, catch them and return a meaningful error representation. This could be raising a custom, more specific exception type to be handled upstream, or returning an error structure (perhaps using the `types.TextContent` format with `type='error'`).",
            "**Map to Appropriate Status Codes:** If this code is used in a web service, the exception handling logic (either here or in the calling layer) should map specific error conditions (e.g., resource not found from API -> 404, API unavailable -> 503, invalid input -> 400) to the correct HTTP status codes.",
            "**Avoid Exposing Internal Details:** Ensure that error messages returned to the client (if any) are generic and do not contain stack traces, internal function names, file paths, or raw error messages from dependencies.",
            "**Consider User-Friendly Messages:** For common, expected errors (like 'not found'), return a clear, user-friendly message within the structured error response."

Log the full original error object (including stack trace, type, and message) along with relevant context (e.g., tool name, arguments received) before re-throwing or formatting the client response. Use a dedicated logging library.",

Distinguish clearly between client errors (e.g., invalid arguments -> `ErrorCode.InvalidRequest` -> 4xx) and server-side/database issues (e.g., connection failure, query execution error -> `ErrorCode.InternalError` -> 5xx). Ensure the external mapping layer respects this distinction.",

This is controlled by an `ssl_verify` boolean flag.",
          "findings": [
            "**Lack of Certificate Validation (Intentional):** The core feature of `SSLIgnoreAdapter` is to disable TLS certificate validation (`context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE`) and hostname checking (`context.check_hostname = False`). This is explicitly implemented when `ssl_verify` is `False`. This completely bypasses the security guarantees of TLS against Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.",
            "**Weak TLS Configuration:** The `SSLIgnoreAdapter` explicitly enables `SSL_OP_ALLOW_UNSAFE_LEGACY_RENEGOTIATION` and `SSL_OP_LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT`. Allowing unsafe legacy renegotiation is particularly dangerous as it can make the connection vulnerable to specific MitM attacks (related to CVE-2009-3555). Enabling legacy server connect might be necessary for very old servers but indicates potential compatibility issues and reliance on older, possibly less secure protocols/features.",
            "**Potential for Insecure Deployment:** While the disabling mechanism is conditional (`if not ssl_verify:`), the existence and use of this code (as shown in tests relying on environment variables like `CONFLUENCE_SSL_VERIFY=\"false\"`) indicate that disabling verification is an expected use case. Relying on environment variables or configuration flags to disable security can easily lead to insecure deployments, especially in production.",

While the adapter's primary purpose is related to SSL/TLS settings, mounting it for HTTP seems unnecessary and potentially confusing, although likely harmless in this specific implementation regarding security.",

The tests explicitly check that the original exception message is present, indicating no wrapping or specific handling at this level.\n2.  **Implicit Try-Except for Data Processing:** The `test_malformed_result_set` implies that the `execute_query` function likely contains internal `try-except` blocks to handle errors (e.g., `AttributeError`, `IndexError`, `KeyError`) when processing potentially malformed *results* returned by the Kusto client, returning a default value (`[]`) instead of raising an exception in this specific case.",

This is for testing, not runtime handling.\n2.  **Custom Event Handlers:** Files like `test_appbuilder_client_toolcall_event_handler_error.py`, `test_appbuilder_client_chatflow_event_handler_v2.py`, and `test_assistant_e2e_stream_event_handler.py` define classes inheriting from `AppBuilderEventHandler` or `AssistantEventHandler`.

These decorators appear to re-raise exceptions but might modify logging/tracing behavior based on environment variables (`APPBUILDER_TRACE_DEBUG`, `APPBUILDER_SDK_TRACE_ENABLE`).\n4.  **Basic File Handling Checks:** `print_components_error_info.py` uses `os.path.exists` before attempting to read files.\n5.  **Implicit Framework Handling:** Much of the error handling for runtime issues (e.g., API call failures, unexpected data formats within the `appbuilder` library) seems reliant on the `appbuilder` framework itself, which is not fully shown.

          "mechanism": "The primary error handling mechanism visible in the provided *test* code is the use of `try...catch` blocks within individual test cases (`it` blocks). These are used to assert that the handlers under test (`spaceHandlers`, `entryHandlers`, etc.) throw errors under specific conditions (e.g., invalid IDs, non-existent resources). One specific test (`ai-action-handler.test.ts`) shows evidence of the handler itself catching an underlying error and returning a structured error object (`{ isError: true, message: '...' }`). This suggests that at least some handlers might implement internal try-catch logic to format errors before they propagate. There is no direct evidence of global error handlers or middleware in the provided test snippets, although such mechanisms might exist elsewhere in the application.",

            "Information Disclosure: The tests for most handlers (`spaceHandlers`, `entryHandlers`, `contentTypeHandlers`, `assetHandlers`) only assert that an error exists (`expect(error).to.exist`) without inspecting the error's content. This leaves open the possibility that raw errors from underlying SDKs or detailed internal messages could be thrown, potentially leaking sensitive information if not caught and sanitized by a higher-level handler (not shown). The `aiActionHandlers` test, however, shows a positive pattern where a specific, potentially sanitized message is extracted and returned in a structured format.",
            "Stack Traces Exposed: The tests do not provide evidence of stack traces being exposed *to the user*. However, since the content of errors thrown by most handlers isn't verified, it's not possible to definitively rule out stack trace exposure in production without seeing the handler implementation or global error handling.",
            "Inconsistent Error Formats: There's evidence of potential inconsistency. The AI action handler appears to return a structured object (`{ isError: true, message: '...' }`) upon error, while the tests for other handlers imply they might just `throw` whatever error they encounter (e.g., SDK errors, standard `Error` objects), leading to different formats depending on the operation.",
            "Missing Error Logging: The provided test code does not show any server-side error logging mechanisms. While not expected in test files themselves, this analysis cannot confirm if the handlers or a global mechanism logs errors for monitoring and debugging purposes.",

It performs basic type coercion for input variables expected to be strings (handling potential arrays from URI templates). It lacks explicit input sanitization, format validation, and relies heavily on the underlying database connector implementation for security against injection attacks. The `schemasResourceHandler` performs no input validation as it doesn't directly process user-provided parameters for its core function.",
          "findings": [
            "Potential SQL Injection: In `tableStructureResourceHandler`, `tableName` and `schemaName` variables derived from user input (`variables`) are passed to database connector methods (`tableExists`, `getTableSchema`) without apparent sanitization or guaranteed parameterization within this code layer. The security relies entirely on the connector's implementation handling these inputs safely (e.g., using parameterized queries).",
            "Potential XSS: User-provided `tableName` and `schemaName` are included in error messages (`createResourceErrorResponse`) and success responses (`responseData`). If these are rendered without proper escaping by downstream components (the error formatter utility or a frontend client), it could lead to Reflected or Stored XSS vulnerabilities.",
            "Incomplete Type Checking: The code checks if `tableName` and `schemaName` are arrays and takes the first element, then casts `as string`. It doesn't strictly validate that the resulting value *is* a string using `typeof`, potentially leading to runtime errors or unexpected behavior if the input within the array (or the variable itself if not an array) is not string-like (e.g., `null`, `undefined`, number).",
            "Missing Format Validation: There's no validation on the *format* of `tableName` and `schemaName` (e.g., checking for allowed characters for identifiers, enforcing length limits). Malformed names might cause database errors or potentially bypass checks if they contain unexpected characters not handled by the connector.",
            "Reliance on Connector Implementation: The security of the `tableStructureResourceHandler` against SQL Injection is entirely dependent on the implementation details of the `ConnectorManager.getCurrentConnector()` methods (`getSchemas`, `tableExists`, `getTableSchema`), which are not shown in the provided code.",
            "Good Semantic Validation: The checks performed in `tableStructureResourceHandler` for schema existence (`availableSchemas.includes(schemaName)`) and table existence (`connector.tableExists`) before proceeding are good practices for preventing unnecessary database operations and providing clearer error messages.",

            "Implement Input Sanitization/Validation: Before passing `tableName` and `schemaName` to connector methods in `tableStructureResourceHandler`, add explicit validation logic: a) Strictly check `typeof value === 'string'` after handling the array possibility. b) Validate against allowed character sets for database identifiers (e.g., alphanumeric, underscore, possibly others depending on the DB). c) Enforce reasonable length limits based on database constraints. d) Reject inputs failing these checks with specific error messages.",

Ensure any client application rendering data from the success response also properly encodes/escapes `tableName`, `schemaName`, and column details to prevent XSS.",
            "Improve Type Handling: Replace `as string` casts with explicit type checks (e.g., `typeof variables.tableName === 'string'` or `typeof variables.tableName[0] === 'string'`). Return a clear error response if the type is incorrect.",

There's also custom validation logic implemented using `@field_validator` (`_try_parse_json` in `JSONParsingModel`) and `@model_validator` (`validate_container_id` in `RecreateContainerInput`).

For example, fields like `container_id`, `name`, `image`, `tag`, `path`, `command`, `entrypoint`, `network`, `environment` keys/values, `labels` are not checked for potentially malicious characters or patterns.",

A non-standard use of HTTP Basic Authentication where a token is provided instead of credentials, formatted as `Authorization: Basic base64(token)`. This deviates from standard practices like Bearer tokens (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).",

            "**Non-Standard Token Authentication:** Using the `Basic` scheme prefix with a base64 encoded token (`btoa(AUTH_ENV_VARS.token)`) is unconventional. Standard token-based authentication (like JWT or OAuth 2.0) typically uses the `Bearer` scheme (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`). This implementation might rely on a custom server-side interpretation or could be a misunderstanding of how to send bearer tokens.",
            "**Credentials/Token Transmitted via Base64:** HTTP Basic Authentication uses Base64 encoding, which is easily reversible and provides no confidentiality. The security of the credentials/token relies entirely on the transport layer (HTTPS). If the connection were ever downgraded to HTTP, the credentials/token would be sent in the clear.",

If stored insecurely (e.g., in plain text files, version control, insecure CI/CD variables), they can still be compromised. This is outside the scope of the code itself but relevant to its deployment.",

It's unclear if this is intended to be a JWT, an OAuth token, a simple API key, or some other format.

            "**Implement Refresh Token Mechanism:** If using an authentication system that supports refresh tokens (like OAuth 2.0), implement logic to securely store and use refresh tokens to obtain new access tokens when the current one expires. Avoid using long-lived access tokens.",

This script takes command-line arguments. `validate_features.py` uses hardcoded, presumably trusted inputs. Both scripts rely heavily on downstream functions (imported from `ergo_explorer.tools`) to handle the actual data processing and any further validation or sanitization. Error handling (`try...except Exception`) is used to catch failures during the execution of these downstream functions.",

Sanitization responsibility is implicitly delegated to the imported functions.",

This provides an earlier failure point for malformed inputs.",

            "**Potential for Prompt Injection:** The user-provided `message` is directly used as the `user_prompt` sent to the LLM in `_validate_relevance`. A crafted message could potentially manipulate the LLM to bypass the intended filtering logic (e.g., instructing the LLM to ignore its rules and return `should_ignore: false`).",

It uses `str(...).lower()` for boolean conversion, which is somewhat brittle. It lacks checks for key existence or type before access/conversion, relying on a broad `except Exception`.",

There is no evidence of global error handlers or dedicated error handling middleware in the provided snippets. The test file (`handlers.test.js`) also uses `try...catch` extensively for handling setup/teardown errors (e.g., Docker interactions, network calls) and within helper functions.",

This inconsistency makes reliable error handling difficult for the client.",

The caller receives a generic error structure often containing the raw upstream message, making it hard to differentiate between client errors (e.g., bad query) and server errors (e.g., InfluxDB unavailable) without parsing potentially sensitive strings.",

There is no explicit **Sanitization** being performed on string inputs.",
          "findings": [
            "**Good Use of Schema Validation:** Zod is effectively used to enforce the structure and basic types for `MessageSchema` and `ListTicketsArgumentsSchema`.",

            "**Type Checking:** Zod inherently performs type checking based on the defined schemas (e.g., `z.string()`, `z.number()`).",
            "**Incomplete Validation (`MessageSchema`):** The use of `z.unknown()` for `params`, `result`, and `error.data` in `MessageSchema` is too permissive. It validates that *something* exists but doesn't check the structure or content *within* these fields, potentially allowing unexpected or malicious data to pass validation if downstream code assumes a specific structure.",
            "**Missing Validation/Sanitization (String Inputs):** The `keyword` and `exclude` fields in `ListTicketsArgumentsSchema` are validated only as optional strings. There's no validation for length, character sets, or potential malicious content. This is a significant gap.",

If the structure truly varies, consider using `z.discriminatedUnion` based on the `method` field.",

          "mechanism": "The primary error handling mechanism observed is the use of local `try...catch` blocks within the specific `handle*` methods for each tool/operation (e.g., `handleReason`, `handleRead`, `handleWrite`). When an error is caught, it is logged using a dedicated `Logger` instance, and then a `CallToolResult` object is returned, embedding the error message (`error.message` or `String(error)`) within the `text` field of the response content. Errors occurring before a specific handler is chosen (e.g., an unknown `toolName` in the main `handle` method) result in an `Error` being thrown, which is not caught locally within these handlers and presumably propagates upwards.",
          "findings": [
            "**Information Disclosure:** The most significant issue is that raw error messages (`error.message` or `String(error)`) are directly included in the `CallToolResult` returned to the caller in almost all `catch` blocks. This can leak sensitive information like internal file paths (e.g., from filesystem errors), specific library error details, or internal logic flaws (e.g., 'Invalid relationTo index').",
            "**Stack Traces:** Stack traces are not directly exposed in the `CallToolResult` sent back to the user/caller. However, they are likely logged internally via `this.logger.error(\"...\"), error)`, which is appropriate for debugging but needs secure log management.",
            "**Inconsistent Error Formats:** While errors caught within the `handle*` methods are consistently formatted into a `CallToolResult` that mimics a successful response structure (embedding the error message in `content[0].text`), errors thrown *before* reaching these handlers (like 'Unknown tool') are not caught locally and will likely result in a different error format depending on upstream handling. This creates inconsistency.",
            "**Missing Error Logging:** Error logging (`this.logger.error`) is generally present within the `catch` blocks of the specific `handle*` methods. However, errors thrown directly from the main `handle` method (e.g., 'Unknown tool') are not logged at this level.",
            "**Improper HTTP Status Codes (Implied):** The pattern of returning a standard `CallToolResult` structure even for errors (just with an error message inside the `text` field) strongly suggests that the upstream caller might return an HTTP 200 OK status code for what should be client (4xx) or server (5xx) errors. This makes programmatic error detection difficult for clients.",
            "**Lack of Graceful Degradation:** While the system attempts to return an error message instead of crashing when an operation fails, the information disclosure issue undermines graceful degradation from a security standpoint. Additionally, errors like the `relationTo` index check in `handleReason` halt processing midway, which might not be the desired behavior.",
            "**Input Validation Errors:** Some validation logic exists (e.g., `validateArgs`, checks within `handleWrite`), but errors arising from this validation (e.g., 'Content required for write operation') are also directly exposed in the response.",
            "**Potential for Unhandled Exceptions:** Errors thrown from the main `handle` method or potentially from asynchronous operations within `handleThink` (though less likely) might crash the process if not handled by a global error handler or middleware layer, which is not shown in the provided code."

Log the detailed error, including the original message and stack trace, internally for debugging.",
            "**Standardize Error Response Structure:** Define a distinct structure for error responses within `CallToolResult`, separate from successful responses. For example: `{ error: { code: 'REASONING_FAILED', message: 'Failed to process thoughts.' } }` or similar. This allows callers to reliably distinguish success from failure.",
            "**Implement Centralized/Global Error Handling:** Introduce a higher-level error handler (e.g., middleware in an Express app, or a global `uncaughtException` handler) to catch errors that escape the local `try...catch` blocks (like 'Unknown tool' or unexpected exceptions). This handler should log the error and return a standardized, sanitized error response.",
            "**Use Appropriate Status Codes (Upstream):** Ensure the component calling these handlers translates the standardized error responses into appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for bad input, 500 for internal server errors) if this is part of a web service.",
            "**Enhance Input Validation:** Perform strict input validation *before* attempting operations, especially for file paths (ensure `context.validatePath` is robust against traversal attacks) and potentially complex inputs like `JournalReadArgs` dates. Return specific validation error codes/messages without leaking internal details.",
            "**Use Custom Error Types:** Consider defining custom error classes (e.g., `ValidationError`, `FileSystemOperationError`, `JournalError`) extending `Error`. This allows `catch` blocks to handle different error types more specifically if needed and improves code clarity.",
            "**Review Logging Practices:** Ensure that logged errors contain sufficient context (e.g., relevant arguments, context state) for debugging but avoid logging excessively sensitive data unless absolutely necessary and properly secured.",
            "**Consider Transactionality/Rollback (where applicable):** For operations involving multiple steps (like `handleReason` processing multiple thoughts), consider if partial failures should allow continuation or require a rollback/cleanup of already processed steps."

          "score": 2,
          "mechanism": "No explicit error handling mechanisms (like try-catch blocks) are present within the provided handler functions. Errors originating from the underlying `RabbitMQConnection`, `RabbitMQAdmin` objects, or the RabbitMQ client library (e.g., pika, requests) will propagate upwards, presumably to be caught by a higher-level handler (like web framework middleware or a global exception hook), or crash the process if uncaught.",
          "findings": [
            "**Missing Error Handling:** None of the functions implement `try...except` blocks to handle potential exceptions during RabbitMQ operations (e.g., connection errors, authentication failures, channel errors, queue/exchange not found, network issues, API errors from the admin interface).",
            "**Information Disclosure Risk:** If exceptions are not caught and handled properly by a higher layer, raw exception messages and potentially full stack traces could be exposed to the client/user. This can reveal internal implementation details, library versions, file paths, and potentially sensitive configuration data, aiding attackers.",
            "**Stack Traces Exposed to Users:** Directly related to information disclosure, uncaught exceptions often result in stack traces being displayed, which is a significant security vulnerability.",
            "**Inconsistent Error Formats:** Without explicit handling, the format of errors returned to the client will depend entirely on how the upstream handler (or the default server behavior) formats uncaught exceptions. This leads to inconsistency.",
            "**Missing Error Logging:** There are no logging statements (`logging.error`, `logger.exception`, etc.) within these functions to record failures. This makes debugging operational issues extremely difficult and hinders monitoring.",
            "**Improper HTTP Status Codes (Potential):** While these functions don't directly handle HTTP responses, the lack of specific error handling prevents mapping specific failure conditions (e.g., 'Queue Not Found', 'Permission Denied') to appropriate HTTP status codes (like 404 or 403) in the calling layer. Uncaught exceptions typically lead to a generic 500 Internal Server Error.",
            "**Lack of Graceful Degradation:** Operations fail abruptly. For instance, if `rabbitmq.get_channel()` fails, the function crashes without attempting cleanup or returning a specific error state. In `handle_enqueue` and `handle_fanout`, if `basic_publish` fails, the `connection.close()` might not be reached, potentially leaving resources open longer than necessary (though `pika` might handle some of this internally depending on the `RabbitMQConnection` implementation)."
          ],
          "recommendations": [
            "**Implement Try-Except Blocks:** Wrap RabbitMQ operations within `try...except` blocks in each handler function to catch specific exceptions (e.g., `pika.exceptions.AMQPConnectionError`, `pika.exceptions.ChannelClosedByBroker`, `requests.exceptions.RequestException` for admin calls, `KeyError` for list comprehensions).",
            "**Use Context Managers:** Refactor `handle_enqueue` and `handle_fanout` to use context managers (`with`) for acquiring and releasing connections/channels, ensuring resources are closed even if errors occur.",
            "**Define Custom Exceptions or Error Codes:** Create specific, custom exception classes (e.g., `QueueNotFoundError`, `PublishError`, `AdminOperationFailed`) or return specific error codes/objects. This allows the calling layer (e.g., API endpoint) to understand the failure mode.",
            "**Implement Robust Logging:** Add detailed logging within `except` blocks. Log the exception details (including stack trace) for internal debugging, but *do not* expose this information to the client.",
            "**Standardize Error Responses:** Ensure the higher-level request handler catches exceptions raised by these functions and translates them into standardized, user-friendly error responses. These responses should include an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., 404, 400, 500, 503) and a generic error message *without* sensitive details.",
            "**Centralized Error Handling:** Consider using or improving centralized error handling (e.g., web framework middleware, global exception handlers) to catch exceptions propagated from these handlers, log them, and return standardized responses.",
            "**Handle 'Not Found' Cases:** Specifically handle cases where queues or exchanges might not exist (e.g., catch the specific exception raised by the admin client or `pika` for non-existent resources) and return a clear indication (like raising `QueueNotFoundError` or returning `None` with appropriate logging)."

When an error is caught, a helper function `getErrorMessage` is used to extract a message, which is then embedded in a specific return structure `{ isError: true, content: [...] }`. \n\nThe `src/services/error.ts` file provides more sophisticated error handling utilities, including a custom `ReplicateError` class, helper functions for creating specific error types (`createError`), and an `ErrorHandler` object with methods for retries (`withRetries`), parsing API errors (`parseAPIError`), and creating structured error reports (`createErrorReport`). However, these more advanced utilities (especially logging via `createErrorReport`) do not appear to be utilized within the `catch` blocks of the handlers in `handlers.ts`.",

If the caller doesn't map this `isError: true` flag to an appropriate HTTP error status code (e.g., 4xx, 5xx), the API might return errors with a 200 OK status, which is incorrect.",

These catch blocks delegate the error processing to a centralized static class method, `ErrorHandler.handleError`. This central handler attempts to classify the error (Axios error, McpError, generic Error, unknown) and re-throws a standardized `McpError`. Input validation errors are handled proactively using `ErrorHandler.validateRequiredParam`, which throws an `McpError` directly. There is one instance (`ToolHandler.handleOpenImageInBrowser`) that uses a local `try...catch` and returns an error structure instead of throwing.",

This is often done in a global exception handler (e.g., JAX-RS `ExceptionMapper`, Spring `@ControllerAdvice`).",

Parsing is also used to separate commands and arguments.",
          "findings": [
            "**Critical Command Injection Vulnerability:** The `resolveCommandPath` function directly uses the unsanitized `command` input within a string passed to `child_process.execAsync` (`where \"${command}\"`). This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by crafting the input `command` string (e.g., `\" & echo vulnerable #`).",
            "**Incomplete Blocklist Validation:** `isCommandBlocked` and `isArgumentBlocked` rely on blocklists, which are inherently incomplete. An attacker could potentially find dangerous commands or arguments not present in the lists.",
            "**Argument Blocking Weakness:** `isArgumentBlocked` uses regex `^${blocked}$` which only matches exact arguments. It would not block arguments combined with others (e.g., `-xvf` if only `-x` is blocked) or arguments containing values (e.g., `--output=file.txt` if `--output` is blocked).",
            "**Potential Shell Operator Bypass:** `validateShellOperators` uses regex to find blocked operators in the raw command string. This can be bypassed through various means depending on the shell, such as using different syntax, command substitution (if not blocked), or environment variables.",
            "**Brittle Command Parsing:** The `parseCommand` function's logic for splitting commands and arguments, especially handling paths with spaces and extensions, appears complex and potentially brittle. Edge cases (nested quotes, escaped characters, unusual spacing, non-Windows paths) might lead to incorrect parsing, potentially causing security checks to operate on misinterpreted data.",
            "**Limited Command Name Extraction:** `extractCommandName` only removes specific extensions (`.exe`, `.cmd`, `.bat`). It might miss other executable types (e.g., `.ps1`, `.vbs`, `.com`, or extensionless executables common on Linux/macOS if used cross-platform).",
            "**Path Validation Bypass Potential:** `isPathAllowed` relies on `startsWith` after normalization. While `path.normalize` helps prevent basic traversal, sophisticated traversal techniques or symlink issues (depending on the environment where the command is executed) might still be possible.",
            "**Missing Input Length Validation:** No checks are performed on the length of input strings (commands, arguments, paths), potentially leading to Denial of Service or unexpected behavior in underlying system calls if excessively long inputs are provided.",
            "**Missing Character Encoding Validation:** Inputs are assumed to be in a standard encoding (like UTF-8), but no explicit validation occurs.",
            "**Implicit Trust in `where` Command:** `resolveCommandPath` relies on the external `where` command being available and behaving as expected. Its output parsing is basic.",

Use `child_process.spawn` with the command and arguments separated, or find a library/API for path resolution that doesn't involve shell execution. If `exec` must be used, rigorously sanitize the `command` input to disallow any shell metacharacters.",
            "**Prefer Allowlisting:** Where possible, use allowlists instead of blocklists for commands and arguments, as they are generally more secure.",
            "**Strengthen Argument Validation:** Improve `isArgumentBlocked` to handle arguments more robustly, potentially parsing arguments using a dedicated library that understands common conventions (e.g., POSIX, GNU).",
            "**Use Safer Execution Methods:** Instead of relying solely on `validateShellOperators`, prioritize using execution methods like `child_process.spawn` that take the command and arguments separately, avoiding shell interpretation altogether. This mitigates risks associated with shell operators and command substitution.",
            "**Improve Command Parsing:** Consider using a well-tested command-line parsing library to handle the complexities of splitting commands and arguments reliably, reducing the risk of parsing errors leading to bypasses.",
