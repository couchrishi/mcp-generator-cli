  - Corpus Builder: Implemented
  - Schema Generator: Implemented
  - Vertex AI Setup (create/delete datastore/app): Implemented
  - Data Import: Implemented
  - Debug API: Implemented
  - Simple API: Implemented
  - Search API: Implemented with basic functionality
  - Advanced Search API: Implemented with pagination, facets, semantic search, and enhanced filtering

- Pending Enhancements:
  - Result ranking options
  - Integration with generative AI for answer generation
  - Security filtering and ranking
  - Performance optimizations
  - API authentication and rate limiting
  - Web interface for demonstration

## Current Tasks

[2025-04-14 01:52:52] - **Troubleshooting Vertex AI Data Inconsistency**
- Status: Resolved
- Description: Investigated missing fields in search results despite correct data preparation and import using custom schema. Debugging revealed data inconsistency within the Vertex AI index.
- Resolution Steps:
  1. Verified data preparation script (`prepare_vertex_data.py`) output (NDJSON).
  2. Verified local schema file (`vertex_ai_schema.json`).
  3. Verified import script (`import_data.py`) logic.
  4. Attempted `FULL` re-import with custom schema - issue persisted.
  5. Identified discrepancy between console schema and local schema (extra `structData` object field in console).
  6. Attempted schema update via script - failed due to API limitations/errors.
  7. Recreated data store and search app (v5).
  8. Switched import process to use **schema auto-detection**.
  9. Performed `FULL` import with auto-detection.
  10. Verified search script (`simple_mcp_search.py`) now returns complete data.

[2025-04-14 01:52:52] - **Next Development Phase**
- Status: Planning
- Description: Planning next steps for the MCP search project.
- Focus Areas:
  1. Create a demonstration web interface.
  2. Implement unit tests for API components.
  3. Explore generative AI integration for answer generation.
  4. Consider authentication and rate limiting mechanisms.
  5. Clean up unused v3/v4 resources in Google Cloud.
[2025-04-14 02:03:11] - **Verification with Semantic Search**
- Status: Completed
- Description: Tested the v5 Enterprise search app using `mcp_advanced_api.py` with semantic search enabled.
- Findings:
  - Semantic search successfully executed using the Enterprise app.
  - Querying for "cryptocurrency API" yielded highly relevant results (cryptopanic, whale-tracker, coin_api_mcp), confirming improved relevance compared to basic text search or broader queries.
  - The core data inconsistency issue is resolved.
