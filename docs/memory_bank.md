# MCP Server Generator CLI - Memory Bank

## Project Overview
The MCP Server Generator CLI is a command-line tool that generates customized MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers based on natural language project descriptions. It addresses tool/function limits in development environments by creating hybrid MCP servers with only necessary tools across multiple service providers.

## Architecture
The architecture consists of five main components:
1. **CLI Interface**: Handles user interaction and manages application flow
2. **Project Analyzer**: Analyzes existing projects or creates new ones
3. **LLM Interaction Service**: Communicates with the Gemini API
4. **MCP Registry**: Manages the database of available MCP servers
5. **Code Generator**: Generates customized MCP server code

A detailed architecture document is available at `docs/architecture.md`.

## Current Project State
- Architecture design has been completed and documented
- Basic project structure has been set up following the architecture design
- Main component directories and files have been created:
  - src/analyzer/
  - src/cli/
  - src/generator/
  - src/llm/
  - src/registry/
  - src/utils/
- Template directories have been created
- Data registry structure has been established
- Git repository initialized and pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/couchrishi/mcp-generator-cli

## Next Steps
- Implement core functionality for each component
- Set up testing framework
- Implement CLI command handling
- Integrate with Gemini API for LLM processing
- Create MCP server templates
- Implement code generation logic

## Key Decisions
- Using Node.js for implementation
- Following a modular, component-based architecture
- Using STDIO interface (not SSE) for MCP servers
- Supporting existing and new projects
- Focusing on REST API integrations with common service providers

## Open Questions
- How will we handle API versioning across different providers?
- How do we ensure proper error handling in generated code?
- What is the strategy for keeping API specifications up-to-date?
- How will authentication credentials be managed securely?
