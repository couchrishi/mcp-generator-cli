# Product Requirements Document: MCP Server Generator

## Overview
The MCP Server Generator is a command-line tool that generates customized MCP servers based on natural language project descriptions. It addresses the challenge of tool/function limits in development environments like Cursor or Roo Code by creating hybrid MCP servers with only the necessary tools across multiple service providers.

## Problem Statement
Development environments like Cursor and Roo Code impose limits on the number of tools that can be used simultaneously (e.g., Cursor's limit is 40). However, developers often need access to tools from various service providers (GitHub, Slack, etc.). An end user typically only needs a subset of tools from each provider, making the standard approach inefficient.

## Solution
Our solution enables developers to:
1. Describe their project in natural language
2. Based on this description, the system will:
   - Select appropriate MCP servers from our registry
   - Choose only the required tools under each MCP server
   - Generate a new hybrid MCP server containing a targeted mix of tools
   - Create direct REST API calls to the appropriate provider functions

## Target Users
- Developers using Cursor, Roo Code, or similar IDEs with tool/function limits
- Development teams needing optimized access to multiple service providers

## Scope and Constraints
### In Scope
- NodeJS MCP server generation
- STDIO interface (not SSE)
- CLI-based interaction
- Support for existing and new projects
- REST API integrations with common service providers

### Out of Scope for Initial Release
- Python, Go, or other language support
- SSE interface
- GUI/web interface
- Custom API endpoint creation

## User Experience
### User Flow
1. Launch CLI using command: `npx generate-mcp-server`
2. Select project type:
   - Existing project (specify folder path)
   - New project (create and initialize new folder)
   - If no path is specified, use current working directory
3. Provide project description:
   - Enter detailed description directly in terminal
   - OR specify path to a .txt file containing description
4. Review and confirm generated server
5. Option to run the generated server immediately (localhost stdio)
6. Save and integrate the generated MCP server with mcp_server.json configuration

### CLI Command Options
```
npx generate-mcp-server [options]

Options:
  -p, --project <path>    Path to existing project
  -d, --description <path>    Path to project description file
  -o, --output <path>     Output directory for generated files
  -h, --help              Display help information
  -v, --verbose           Enable verbose logging
```

## Technical Requirements

   - Parse package.json for dependencies
   - Extract relevant information from project structure

3. **LLM Interaction Service**
   - Prepare context for Gemini API
   - Process and parse responses
   - Handle error cases and retry logic

4. **MCP Registry**

   - Metadata for each server including available tools
   - Version tracking and compatibility information

5. **Code Generator**
   - Template-based code generation
   - Proper formatting and documentation
   - Integration with existing codebase (if applicable)

### API Integration Requirements
1. **Service Provider API Registry**

   - Authentication requirements
   - Rate limiting information
   - Common endpoint documentation

2. **API Client Templates**
   - Reusable patterns for different API types
   - Error handling boilerplate
   - Authentication flow templates

### Data Flow
1. User inputs project description
2. Description is analyzed to identify required capabilities
3. System queries MCP registry to identify relevant servers
4. System selects necessary tools from each server
5. Code generation templates are populated with:
   - Selected tool definitions
   - API integration code
   - Authentication requirements
6. Generated code is formatted and documented
7. Files are created/updated in target directory

## LLM Integration Specifics

### Context Preparation
The following will be sent to Gemini API:
1. Project description (from user input)
2. Existing index.ts/js (if modifying existing server)
3. Project structure information:
   - Directory tree representation
   - Package.json contents
   - Main file contents and imports
4. MCP server registry excerpt (relevant entries only)
5. System prompt with generation instructions

### System Instructions
The system prompt will instruct Gemini to:
1. Analyze the project description
2. Identify required service providers and tools
3. Generate a properly structured MCP server index.js file
4. Include direct REST API calls to appropriate providers
5. Add comprehensive documentation
6. Use clear markup to identify files to be created/modified

### Response Parsing
The response will be parsed to extract:
1. Files to be created (with paths and content)
2. Files to be modified (with path, portions to change)
3. Additional context or explanations

## Technical Implementation Details

### MCP Server Structure
The generated MCP server will follow this structure:
```
mcp-server/
├── index.js            # Main entry point
├── providers/          # Provider-specific API clients
│   ├── github.js       # GitHub API client
│   ├── slack.js        # Slack API client
│   └── ...
├── tools/              # Tool implementations
│   ├── github_tools.js # GitHub-specific tools
│   ├── slack_tools.js  # Slack-specific tools
│   └── ...
├── utils/              # Utility functions
│   ├── auth.js         # Authentication helpers
