# MCP Server Generator Project

This repository contains two main components:

## Documentation

The `docs` directory at the root level contains:
- `memory_bank.md` - Project context and history
- `architecture.md` - Comprehensive architecture design

These documents serve as a single source of truth for both components.

## MCP Generator

The `mcp-generator` directory contains a Node.js implementation of the MCP Server Generator CLI tool. It generates customized MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers based on natural language project descriptions.

## MCP Search

The `mcp-search` directory contains Python tools for creating a semantic search layer for MCP servers. It includes scripts for crawling documentation and implementing semantic search functionality.

See the README.md files in each directory for more detailed instructions.
